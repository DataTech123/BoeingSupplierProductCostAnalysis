A brief introduction to the above suppliersâ€™ product cost analysis.

Assume that it interacts with the existing database without being design a new database. I use machine learning in SQL Server with Python libraries, including Pandas and NumPy to write variable and parameter language codes for query data.
For instance, I analyze two suppliers' purchase product costs to view data within the system. I extract all relevant data, including order date, purchase receipt, warehouse name, item name, stock quantity, and a total cost price from each supplier from 2018 to 2023. This is just my assumption, with a relational database for supplier data, I can follow a real work project from someone at Boeing.

By testing the red code in this project, determine that they are correct in query result.

Thank you for your review. There will be another Python script project that connects SQL Server to Visual Studio Code.
